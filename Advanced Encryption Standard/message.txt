Newly re-signed McLaren driver Lando Norris is confident that the team will be in the mix for race victories in 2024, but the Briton feels he may have to wait a little longer for a championship challenge. McLaren caught the eye last season by going from struggling to score points to regularly fighting for podiums, with highly effective upgrades being implemented following a technical reshuffle. Norris came close to scoring McLaren's first Grand Prix win since 2021 on several occasions, taking six P2 finishes, while team mate Oscar Piastri managed to triumph in the Qatar Sprint Race.
