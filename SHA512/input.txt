Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu is the greatest romance, slice of life manga I've ever read. It is a series of constant progress that respects the reader's time and trusts them to read between the lines - Characters make mistakes and learn from them. Misunderstandings are never used to pad out the story, and never feel cheap. Progress is never undone. It is one of the most fully realized depictions of the liminal space between two young people as they begin to fall in love - The roller coaster between bubbly feelings and crippling cringe that is first love is so difficult to portray. I've never encountered another manga that has managed to capture this specific feeling so accurately and with so much detail.
